            <subsection name="Introduction">
                <p>This plugin stores identities. An identity is composed of attributes. Each attribute can be read, written or certified by the application calling the service.</p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="REST API">
                <p>
                   The plugin provides a REST API to manage identities. Several versions of the API can be called:
                   <ul>
                        <li>Version 2 : the URL to use is <code>/identity/rest/identitystore/v2/identity</code>. This version uses the objects of the packages <code>fr.paris.lutece.plugins.identitystore.v2.*</code> of the <code>library-identitystore</code>.</li>
                        <li>Version 3 : the URL to use is <code>/identity/rest/identitystore/v3/identity</code>. This version uses the objects of the packages <code>fr.paris.lutece.plugins.identitystore.v3.*</code> of the <code>library-identitystore</code>.</li>
                   </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Version 2 can be used only for getting an Identity by its CUID or GUID. Only version 3 offers full API usage (CRUD & research).
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Configuration">

                </p>

            <subsection name="Usage">
                <p>
                    The plugins exposes web methods to manage identities. Check <em>/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page=swaggerui</em> page for more details about these methods.
                </p>
            </subsection>
             <subsection name="Deletion of the identity">
                <p>
                    The deletion of an identity from the web service does not really delete it but flags it as 'deleted'. The attributes are deleted.
                    Updating or retrieving an identity flagged 'deleted ' from the web service generates an exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deleting an identity from the GUI completely deletes the identity from the BDD.
                </p>
